Exercise 1-1:

Problem: In the "Hello World!" program, what happens if you
Assumption(s):
1. Leave out one quotation marks: prompts to end the statement under quotation
2. Leave out both: prints Hello is not defined
3. Spell print wrong: prints prnt is not defined
4. Leave out one of the parentheses: raises SyntaxError at the missed out parentheses
5. Leave out both parentheses: raises SyntaxError
6. Put a plus sign before a number (e.g., 2++2): adds and prints out 5
7. Lead a number with a zero (e.g., 02): shows 2
8. Have two values with no operator between them: Prints out the numbers

Result:
1.  File "<stdin>", line 1
    print("Hello World!)
                       ^
SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
2.  File "<stdin>", line 1
    print(Hello World!)
                    ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
3.  File "<stdin>", line 1
    prnt(Hello World!)
                   ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
4. print("Hello World!"
...|

5.  File "<stdin>", line 1
    print "Hello World!"
                       ^
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'
6. 4
7.   File "<stdin>", line 1
    print(02)
           ^
SyntaxError: invalid token
8.  File "<stdin>", line 1
    print(2 4)
            ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Exercise 1-2:

Problem: Use python terminal as a calculator.
Assumption(s):
1. How many seconds are there in 42 minutes and 42 seconds: (42 * 60) + 42 = 2292
2. How many miles are there in 10 km (1 mile = 1.61 km): 10/1.61 = 5.25
3. If you run a 10 kilometer race in 42 minutes 42 seconds, what is your average pace (time per mile in minutes and seconds)? What is your average speed in miles per hour: 2292/5.25 = 458 = 458/60 = 23/3 = 7 m 20 s; 2292/60 = 7.2m/60 = 0.9 h = 5.25/0.9 = 5.25 miles/hr

Result:
1. 2562
2. 6.211180124223602
3. 7m 20s (6.874700000000001); 8.727653570337614 miles/hr
